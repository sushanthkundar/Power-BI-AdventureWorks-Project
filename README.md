This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of key competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, and market opportunities. The findings will inform strategic adjustments to our sales approach and marketing tactics, with the goal of increasing our market share by maximum percentage over the next year and also to enter two new regional markets within the next year. Key activities include market research, identifying potential local partners, and tailoring marketing strategies to meet regional preferences. The project will be measured by market penetration rates and sales volume in the new territories.
